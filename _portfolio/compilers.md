The beginning of this research started with implementing compiler optimizations in the Very Portable Optimizer (VPO) compiler, namely loop unrolling. Following that, I was tasked with performing peer programming to work on detecting global variable dependencies to overlap execution of functions and determine which compiler optimizations could be used.

  - Exposure to compilers and low-level programming
  - Implementation of compiler optimization techniques

**Technologies Used**

  - VPO Compiler
  - C / C++
  - MIPS Assembly
  - Linux / Unix
