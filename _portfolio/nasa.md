**Fall 2020**

I assisted both contractor and NASA engineers in the software design, development, and implementation of automated tests for software to be used in ground based systems. My role comprised of design and development of rules in an open-source linting software that was used in conjunction with our testing framework. The purpose of the linter was to ensure that every functional test followed a very specific set of rules for code-readability, consistency, and simpler debugging to help meet mission or project requirements. Upon my arrival, the linter had very few rules, but working closely with the guidance of my technical lead, my main role was to implement all of the rules defined in a pre-written, English-language style guide. Upon completion of my task, I was to perform code reviews to ensure that any changes that were promoted were written without any prevailing issues.

  - Development of linting software to be used with functional tests
  - Performed code reviews to ensure high-quality code was being put onto the system
  - Proposal and implementation suggestion of an additional linting software

*Technologies include:*

  - Python
  - Java
  - Robot Functional Testing Framework
  - Linux / Unix
  - Bash Scripting

*Achievements include:*

  - Completed existing linting software so that it was ready to be used by all engineers
  - Created the concept of a new linting software for future implementation

**Spring 2021**

My role comprised of design and development of functional tests to ensure the quality of a message passing element of the system. Upon completion of my task, I was to perform code reviews to ensure that any changes that were promoted were written without any prevailing issues.

  - Creation of functional tests for a major message passing system of the launch control system of the SLS rocket
  - Performed code reviews to ensure high-quality code was being put onto the system
  - Created documentation of poorly-documented systems for future interns and developers
  - Worked with and mentored fellow interns who were new to the system

*Technologies include:*

  - Python
  - Robot Functional Testing Framework
  - Jenkins Automation Server
  - Linux / Unix
  - Bash Scripting

*Achievements include:*

  - Awarded NASA OSTEM Intern of the year
  - Made significant improvements to the existing functional test codebase
